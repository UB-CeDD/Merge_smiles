# Merge_python_script
This repository contains a script used to merge two smi files into a single csv file.
The scripts here were made with python 2 hence they don't work as expected, specifically "merge_smiles.py". It rather gives an output identical to the input csv file, without the smiles extracted from the 2 smi flies.
The 2 smi files are included in this repo to play around with the script and see how it could be modified. 
There are comments in the "download_sdfs.py" script to guide you on how to run the scripts.
